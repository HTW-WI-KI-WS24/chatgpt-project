In the kingdom of 
Eldoria, where ancient prophecies foretell an imminent war, the realm is divided between three rival 
factions: the noble Gavarian Empire, the reclusive Forest Keepers, and the mystical Order of the Phoenix. 
The capital city, Lumina, stands as a symbol of unity, but beneath the surface, tensions are high and 
alliances are fragile. Eldoria is a land of towering mountains, deep, dense forests, and rolling meadows 
dotted with enchanting ruins. Mythical creatures, such as majestic unicorns and mischievous sprites, 
roam freely, adding an otherworldly sense of wonder. The kingdom is governed by magic and ruled by knights 
who dedicate their lives to the chivalric code. Our three main characters come from different walks of 
life—a Gavarian noble, an aspiring Forest Keeper, and a novice from the Order of the Phoenix—each chosen 
by destiny to protect Eldoria and prevent the war. As they navigate the treacherous landscape, they must 
forge unlikely friendships and unravel ancient secrets to restore peace and harmony. I'm glad to hear 
that you're happy with the result! If you ever need more help or if you have any further questions or
